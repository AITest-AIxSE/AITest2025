    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        You are invited to participate in the <b>1st International Workshop on Integrated Approaches to Testing Data-Centric AI Systems: Methods, Metrics, and Benchmarks​</b>, to be held as part of the Artificial Intelligence x Software Engineering (aka AIxSoftware), October 1-3, 2025The Hills Hotel, Laguna Hills, California (<a href=" https://www.aixse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIxSE</a>).
    </p>
    <h2>Purpose of the Workshop</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional software testing techniques are insufficient for validating AI systems, which behave probabilistically and rely heavily on data quality. Moreover, most AI testing research has focused on model performance, often overlooking systematic test design, adequacy, and validation frameworks. This workshop seeks to bridge that gap by fostering discussion around experimental methods, case studies, tools, and benchmark creation to support comprehensive AI system testing. Bringing together researchers from software engineering, machine learning, data quality, and systems communities, this workshop will provide a dedicated venue for interdisciplinary collaboration and new perspectives on testing data centric AI.
    </p>
    <p>
	This workshop aims to explore the integration of data quality evaluation with traditional software testing methodologies to improve the reliability, robustness, and trustworthiness of data-centric AI systems. As AI models become central to decision-making in high-stakes domains, there is a growing need to adapt and extend conventional testing frameworks to account for data-driven behaviors, non-determinism, and continuous learning processes. Key topics include test adequacy criteria for AI systems, evaluation of input data quality, robustness testing, explainability under test, benchmark datasets and tools for AI testing, and the emerging area of self-testing AI systems, systems capable of evaluating and improving their own reliability.
    </p>
